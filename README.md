BTC is my first mod and it adds a new structure and a staff item that will be updated in the future to make uses for.
When this mod is finished and able to be downloaded I do recomend https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/novaultlimit
This is because this type of the trial chamber is harder because of more spawners but a lack of vaults(Which i tried to accomodate to) but with
it you can get more loot
