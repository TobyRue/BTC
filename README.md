BTC Mod

BTC is my first Minecraft mod, introducing a new structure and a staff item that will receive future updates to expand its functionality.

Credits
This mod includes contributions from:

TobinOakenshield (GitHub: TobyRue) â€“ Creator of the spell_book model, originally featured in the Infinite Library mod.
Proper credit is given, in the mod description, and in the GitHub repository.
If used elsewhere, the Infinite Library mod will also be credited accordingly.

Recommended Mods
Once BTC is fully released and available for download, I highly recommend using it alongside:

NoVaultLimit (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/novaultlimit)

This is because my version of the Trial Chamber is more challenging due to increased spawner density and fewer vaults. While I have balanced loot accordingly, NoVaultLimit helps ensure a more rewarding experience by increasing available loot
