According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees dont care what humans think is impossible.
The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isnt. By subtracting where it is from where it isnt, or where it isnt from where it is whichever is greater, it obtains a difference, or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the missile from a position where it is to a position where it isnt, and arriving at a position where it wasnt, it now is. Consequently, the position where it is, is now the position that it wasnt, and it follows that the position that it was, is now the position that it isnt. In the event that the position that it is in is not the position that it wasnt, the system has acquired a variation, the variation being the difference between where the missile is, and where it wasnt. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance computer scenario works as follows. Because a variation has modified some of the information the missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isnt, within reason, and it knows where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasnt, or viceversa, and by differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldnt be, and where it was, it is able to obtain the deviation and its variation, which is called error.
We cannot get out. We cannot get out they have taken the bridge and second hall. Frar and Loni and Nali fell there bravely while the rest retreated to Mazarbul. We still holding but hope undying. Oins party went 5 days ago but today only 4 returned. The pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The watcher in the water took Oin. We cannot get out. The end comes soon we hear drums. Drums in the deep. They are coming.
In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat. It was a hobbit hole, and that means comfort.

This was a triumph Im making a note here, Huge success Its hard to overstate my satisfaction Aperture Science We do what we must because we can For the good of all of us, except the ones who are dead But theres no sense crying over every mistake You just keep on trying til you run out of cake And the science gets done, and you make a neat gun For the people who are still alive Im not even angry Im being so sincere right now Even though you broke my heart and killed me And tore me to pieces And threw every piece into a fire As they burned, it hurt because I was so happy for you Now these points of data make a beautiful line And were out of beta, were releasing on time So Im glad I got burned, think of all the things we learned For the people who are still alive
